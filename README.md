## üöÄ **Endpoints**

Here are the available REST API endpoints for managing products:

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                            | Description                           |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|

| **GET**     | `/products/{id}`                    | Retrieve product by ID                |
| **GET**     | `/products/{id}/in-stock`           | Check if the product is in stock      |

### Example Request Payload (Product Creation):

```json
{
  "name": "Laptop",
  "description": "High-end gaming laptop",
  "price": 1500.0,
  "stockQuantity": 10
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to get the **Product Microservice** up and running:

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrajkishor/ecommerce-product-microservice.git
cd ecommerce-product-microservice
```

### 2. **Configure the Database**

Ensure you have a running instance of MySQL or PostgreSQL. Update the database settings in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ecommerce
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

### 3. **Build the Project**

Use Maven to build the project:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

---

## üíª **Run Locally**

To run the service locally, use the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Once the application is running, you can access the service at `http://localhost:8082`.

---

## üß™ **Test Locally**

You can run the unit tests (written using JUnit and Mockito) by executing:

```bash
mvn test
```

The tests ensure that the product creation, retrieval, and stock check features work as expected.

---

## üê≥ **Docker Support**

This project includes a `Dockerfile` for easy containerization. Follow these steps to build and run the Docker container:

### 1. **Build Docker Image**

```bash
docker build -t product-service:latest .
```

### 2. **Run Docker Container**

```bash
docker run -d -p 8082:8082 --name product-service product-service:latest
```

The service will now be accessible at `http://localhost:8082`.

---

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è **Kubernetes Deployment**

To deploy the product service in a Kubernetes cluster, create a Kubernetes manifest (`product-service.yaml`) and apply it using `kubectl`.

### Example Kubernetes Deployment Manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: product-service-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: product-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: product-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: product-service
        image: product-service:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8082
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: product-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: product-service
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8082
    targetPort: 8082
  type: ClusterIP
```

### 1. **Apply Kubernetes Manifest**

```bash
kubectl apply -f product-service.yaml
```

### 2. **Verify Deployment**

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
```
